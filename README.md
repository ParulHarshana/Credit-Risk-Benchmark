# Credit-Risk-Benchmark
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and predictive modeling on a loan dataset to identify customers who are likely to become delinquent in repaying their loans within the next two years.

By analyzing customer data and financial indicators, the model helps predict loan repayment risks, enabling lenders to make informed decisions and manage credit risk effectively.

The project leverages Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to process the data, create meaningful features, and build classification models for accurate prediction.
